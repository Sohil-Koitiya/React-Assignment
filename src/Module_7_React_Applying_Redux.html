    <h3>Q1: What is Redux?</h3>
    <p>Ans : </p>
    <pre>
        Redux is a predictable state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with frameworks like React. 
        It consist of mainly 
        * Store: The central repository where the application state is stored. It acts as the single source of truth for the application's data.
        * Actions: Plain objects that describe an event that has occurred in the application. 
        Each action has a type property that indicates the type of action being performed, and it may include additional data (payload).
        * Reducers: Functions that take the current state and an action as arguments and return a new state. 
        They determine how the state changes in response to actions.
        * Dispatch: The method used to send actions to the store. This is the only way to trigger a state change in Redux.

    <h3>Q3: What is Pure Component? When to use Pure Component over Component?</h3>
    <p>Ans : </p>
    <pre>
        A Pure Component in React is a type of component that extends React.PureComponent. 
        It is designed to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders. 
        A Pure Component only re-renders when its props or state change, which is determined through a shallow comparison 
        of the current and previous values.

        class MyPureComponent extends React.PureComponent {
            render() {
              return (
                <div>
                  <h1>{this.props.title}</h1>
                  <p>{this.props.text}</p>
                </div>
              );
            }
          }

    </pre>

    <h3>Q4:   What is the second argument that can optionally be passed tosetState and what is its purpose?
        </h3>
        <p>Ans : </p>   
        <pre>
            The second argument that can optionally be passed to setState in React is a callback function. 
            This function is executed immediately after the state has been updated and the component has re-rendered.
