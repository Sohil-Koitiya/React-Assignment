        <h3>Q.2 What is JavaScript Output method?</h3>
        <p>Ans :=> </p>
        <pre>           Understanding how to handle JavaScript output is essential for effective web development. 
            JavaScript provides several methods to display output, such as console. 
            log(), alert(), document. write(), and manipulating HTML elements directly.
            Each method has its specific use cases, whether for debugging, user notifications, or dynamically updating web content. 
            This guide will explore various JavaScript output methods, demonstrating how and when to use them effectively.

        <h3>Q.3 How to used JavaScript Output method?</h3>
        <p>Ans :=> </p>
        <pre>            1. JavaScript innerHTML Property :- 

            The innerHTML property is used with HTML element. 
            JavaScript can be used to select an element using the document.getElementById(id) method, 
            and then use the innerHTML property to display the output on the specified element (selected element).

            document.getElementById("id").innerHTML;

            2. JavaScript console.log() Method :-

            The console.log() method is used for logging messages to the console. 
            It is a debugging tool available in most web browsers. 
            It is used during development to output information about the state of the program.

            console.log();

            3. JavaScript document.write() Method :- 

            To use the document.write(), simply call this method and provide the content you want to be written to the document. 
            This method is often used for directly adding content to the HTML document while it is being parsed.

            document.write();

            4. JavaScript window.alert() Method :-

            The window.alert() method is used to display an alert box with a specified output (or message) and an OK button.

            window.alert();

            5. JavaScript window.print() Method :-

            The window.print() method is used to open the browser’s print dialog, 
            allowing the user to print the current page. JavaScript does not contain any default print object or methods.

            window.print();

            6. JavaScript window.prompt() Method :-

            The window.prompt() method is used to display a dialog box that prompts the user input. 
            It returns the text entered by the user as a string. It doesn’t display output directly but captures user input.

            window.prompt();

        <h3>Q.4 How to used JavaScript Events to do all examples?</h3>
        <p>Ans :=> </p>
        <pre>           JavaScript Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser. 
            They can be triggered by various user interactions or by the browser itself.

            Common events include mouse clicks, keyboard presses, page loads, and form submissions. 
            Event handlers are JavaScript functions that respond to these events, allowing developers to create interactive web applications.
