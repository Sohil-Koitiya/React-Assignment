        <h3>Q.1 What is React Js?</h3>
        <p>Ans :=> </p>
        <pre>            React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) on the web. 
            React is a declarative, component based library that allows developers to build reusable UI 
            components and It follows the Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) approach, 
            which optimizes rendering performance by minimizing DOM updates. 
            React is fast and works well with other tools and libraries.
        </pre>

        <h3>Q.2 What is NPM in React Js?</h3>
        <p>Ans :=> </p>
        <pre>            npm, short for Node Package Manager, is a package manager for JavaScript. 
            It is an essential tool in the React ecosystem that simplifies the process of 
            installing, updating, and managing third-party libraries and packages.
            By providing a centralized repository of reusable code, npm enables developers to leverage existing solutions, 
            boost productivity, and maintain code quality.           
            In the context of React, npm plays a pivotal role in managing dependencies, scripts, and other project-related configurations.           
            It allows developers to focus on building innovative user interfaces and functionalities 
            by seamlessly integrating external resources without the hassle of manual management.

        <h3>Q.3 What is Role of Node Js in react Js?</h3>
        <p>Ans :=> </p>
        <pre>            Streamlining Dependency Management

            One of npm’s primary roles in React development is managing dependencies. 
            Dependencies are external packages or libraries that your React project relies on. 
            npm simplifies the process of declaring, installing, and updating these dependencies, 
            ensuring that your project stays up-to-date and functions smoothly.
            
            Efficient Package Installation

            npm provides a straightforward method for installing packages required for your React project. 
            With a simple command, such as npm install package-name, you can effortlessly integrate external 
            functionality into your application. This eliminates the need for manual downloading and copying of files, 
            saving valuable development time.
            
            Enabling Script Execution

            npm enables you to define and execute custom scripts within your React project. 
            These scripts can perform various tasks, such as starting the development server, running tests, 
            and building production-ready assets. This flexibility empowers developers to automate routine processes 
            and maintain consistent workflows.
            
            Version Control and Updates

            Keeping your React project current is essential for security and performance reasons. 
            npm allows you to manage package versions effectively. 
            By specifying version ranges in the package.json file, you can ensure that your project utilizes 
            compatible and up-to-date packages.
            
            Collaboration and Code Sharing

            npm facilitates collaboration among developers by providing a centralized repository for sharing code. 
            You can publish your own packages to npm, making them accessible to the global development community. 
            This encourages knowledge exchange, accelerates project development, and fosters innovation.

        <h3>Q.4 What is CLI command In React Js?</h3>
        <p>Ans :=> </p>
        <pre>           React has its own command-line interface (CLI) commands. 
            However, these CLI commands are currently only used to create a passable 
            version of a react application using the command line. 
            This will contain a default template as its design, 
            so all the react application created this way will have great consistency as they all have same structure.

            Creating a new application

            Create React App provides multiple ways to create React application.

            Using npx script.

            npx create-react-app react-app-name
            npx create-react-app hello-react-app

            Using npm package manager.

            npm init react-app react-app-name
            npm init react-app hello-react-app

            Using yarn package manager.

            yarn init react-app react-app-name
            yarn init react-app hello-react-app
        </pre>
        <hr>
        <h3>Q.5 What is Components in React Js?</h3>
        <p>Ans :=> </p>
        <pre>            React Components are the building block of React Application. 
            They are the reusable code blocks containing logics and and UI elements. 
            They have the same purpose as JavaScript functions and return HTML. 
            Components make the task of building UI much easier. 

            A UI is broken down into multiple individual pieces called components. 
            You can work on components independently and then merge them all into a parent component which will be your final UI. 
            
            Components promote efficiency and scalability in web development by allowing developers to compose, 
            combine, and customize them as needed.

        <h3>Q.6 What is Header and Content Components in React Js?</h3>
        <p>Ans :=> </p>
        <pre>             Header component

            The Header is an important element of a website’s design. It’s the first impression of the website. 
            It provides useful links to other areas of the website that the user may want to visit.
            
            Content Components

            Content Components are sections of content that can be added to multiple pages. 
            The page template determines what Content Components are allowed on a page.

            Content Components can be attached to more than one page, 
            allowing you to make changes in one place and have them carry over 
            to all pages where that component is applied. For example, 
            if a call to action is attached to several pages, it can be updated once 
            instead of going to each page and making the adjustment multiple times.

        <h3>Q.7 How to install React Js on Windows, Linux Operating System? How to install NPM and How to check version of NPM?</h3>
        <p>Ans :=> </p>
        <pre>             How to install React Js on Windows
            
            Steps to Install React JS on Windows

            Step 1: Install Node.js installer for Windows. 

            Here, install the LTS version (the one present on the left). 
            Once downloaded, open NodeJS without disturbing other settings, and click on the Next button until it’s completely installed.

            Step 2: Open the command prompt to check whether it is completely installed or not type the command –> 

            node -v

            If the installation went well it will give you the version you have installed  

            Step 3: Now in the terminal run the below command: 

            npm install -g create-react-app  

            It will globally install react app for you. To check everything  went well run the command 
            
            create-react-app --version

            If everything went well it will give you the installed version of react app



            Linux Operating System?

            Step 1: Installing NPM package manager in Ubuntu

            Since React apps are built primarily with Node.js based JavaScript runtime, we need to install the NPM package manager first.

            Open new Ubuntu terminal window and type:

            sudo apt update

            This will fetch the latest package lists from repositories.

            Now install Node.js environment and NPM tool using apt command:

            sudo apt install nodejs npm

            Supply your system password when prompted

            Verify successful install with:

            node -v
            npm -v

            Step 2: Installing create-React-app Utility

            The create-React-app command line utility allows us to generate React project scaffolds 
            quickly without complex manual configurations. This official tool from Facebook makes starting new apps easier.

            Install it using NPM as a global module with:

            sudo npm install -g create-React-app

            This adds the create-React-app command to your system PATH. Verify it was registered properly with:

            create-React-app --version

            Step 3: Create & Launch Your First React Application

            Now we will use create-React-app to generate our first React project easily:

            create-React-app my-first-React-app
